      <span class="color-changing"> Linux </span> is an open-source, Unix-like operating system based on the
      <span class="color-changing">Linux kernel </span>,
      which was first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.
      It is typically packaged as a <span class="color-changing">Linux distribution </span>(distro) ,
      which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries.
      Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux".
      Linux is widely used in servers, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, and other embedded devices.
      It is also the leading operating system on supercomputers
      and is used in many other applications, such as routers, automation controls, and home appliances.
      <span class="color-changing"> Android's </span> Linux kernel is based on the open-source Linux kernel,
      which is modified and customized by Google and other companies to meet the specific needs of the Android platform.

    <h2> What is <span class="color-changing">Linux distribution </span>?</h2>
    A Linux distribution (distro),
    is an operating system made from a software collection that includes the Linux kernel and
    various other software packages.
    Linux distributions, which are available for a wide variety of systems ranging from embedded devices
    (for example, OpenWrt) and personal computers (for example, Linux Mint) to powerful supercomputers
    (for example, Rocks Cluster Distribution).
    <br>
    There are numerous Linux distributions available, each with its own unique features, strengths, and user
    interfaces. Some popular options include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, and Linux Mint.
    <ul>
      <li> <span class="color-changing"> Ubuntu</span> : A <span class="color-changing"> user-friendly </span> and
        widely used distribution based on Debian. </li>
      <li> <span class="color-changing"> Fedora</span> : A <span class="color-changing">cutting-edge </span>distribution
        that always includes the latest software packages. </li>
      <li> <span class="color-changing"> CentOS</span> : A popular distribution for <span
          class="color-changing">servers</span> and <span class="color-changing">enterprise environments</span> based on

    <h2> <span class="color-changing">Command Line Interface </span> </h2>

    The command line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer by typing
    commands.
    It is a powerful and efficient tool for interacting with Linux systems.
    It gives users more control over their systems and allows them to perform tasks that are not possible with
    a graphical user interface (GUI). <br>
    The CLI can be used to run applications, install software, and manage your system.
    It is also a good way to troubleshoot problems and automate tasks.


    <br><br>

    If you are new to the Linux, it is a good idea to start by learning the basics of the CLI. <br>
