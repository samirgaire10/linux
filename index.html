      <span class="color-changing"> Linux </span> is an open-source, Unix-like operating system based on the <span
        class="color-changing">Linux kernel </span>,
      which was first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.
      It is typically packaged as a <span class="color-changing">Linux distribution </span>(distro) ,
      which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries.
      Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux".
      Linux is widely used in servers, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, and other embedded devices.
      It is also the leading operating system on supercomputers
      and is used in many other applications, such as routers, automation controls, and home appliances.
      <span class="color-changing"> Android's </span> Linux kernel is based on the open-source Linux kernel,
      which is modified and customized by Google and other companies to meet the specific needs of the Android platform.

      <br>
      What is <span class="color-changing">Linux distribution </span>? <br>

      is an operating system made from a software collection that includes the Linux kernel and
      various other software packages.
      Linux distributions, which are available for a wide variety of systems ranging from embedded devices
      (for example, OpenWrt) and personal computers (for example, Linux Mint) to powerful supercomputers
      (for example, Rocks Cluster Distribution).
      <br>
      There are numerous Linux distributions available, each with its own unique features, strengths, and user
      interfaces. Some popular options include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, and Linux Mint.
